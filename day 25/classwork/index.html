            <h2>⚽ Football</h2>
            <p>Football has been my favorite sport since I was a kid. I started playing it in the yard with my neighbors, and I instantly fell in love with the energy and teamwork it requires.</p>
            <p>It helps me stay fit, sharp, and focused. Every match brings something new, whether it's a win, a loss, or just a good challenge. I also love watching football, especially the Champions League. My favorite team is Real Madrid, and I get inspired by how they play with confidence and class.</p>

            <h2>🎵 Music</h2>
            <p>Music is a big part of my daily life. It helps me relax, focus, and sometimes even motivates me when I’m tired or bored. I listen to music almost every day, especially when I’m studying or walking outside.</p>
            <p>I enjoy different types of music such as rock, rap, and sometimes even classical. Some of my favorite artists are Imagine Dragons, NF, and Beethoven. Music speaks louder than words, and I think it connects people from all around the world without using language. One day I hope to learn how to mix music or become a DJ as a side hobby.</p>

            <h2>💻 Coding</h2>
            <p>Coding is one of the most exciting and powerful hobbies I have. It gives me the chance to build websites, solve problems, and create things from scratch. I started with HTML and CSS, and now I’m also learning Python.</p>
            <p>What I like most is that coding makes me think. It's not just about typing code – it’s about logic, structure, and creativity. I enjoy building small websites like this one, and every time I finish a project, I feel proud. In the future, I want to become a programmer and make apps or websites that help people.</p>
            <p>I know it takes time and practice, but I believe that with hard work and patience, I’ll get better and reach my goals.</p>
