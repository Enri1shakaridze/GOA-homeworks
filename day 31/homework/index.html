            <p>Nors, known primarily as a fiction writer, here embarks on a languorous and evocative tour <br> of her native Denmark ... The dramas of the past are evoked not so much through individual <br> characters as through their traces—buildings, ruins, shipwrecks—and this westerly Denmark <br>is less the land of Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales and sleek Georg Jensen designs than a place of ancient landscapes <br> steeped in myth ... People aren’t wholly incidental to the narrative. <br> Nors introduces us to a variety of colorful characters, and shares <br> vivid memories of her family’s time in a cabin on the coast south of Thyborøn. But in a way that recalls the work of Barry  <br>Lopez, nature is at the heart of this beautiful book, <br> framed in essay-like chapters, superbly translated by Caroline Waight <br>
        Who else could have done justice to this wild landscape, the stubborn psyche <br> of its inhabitants, its brutal myths and its toxic industry? ... <br> This elegant and assonant translation by Caroline Waight is a further welcome import ...  <br>A journey in her company is never a dull prospect ...  <br>Along this mutable coast, on the border between map and myth, Nors is in her element.

"We are travelers on a cosmic journey, stardust, swirling and dancing in the eddies and whirlpools of infinity. Life is eternal. We have stopped <br> for a moment to encounter each other, to meet, to love, to share. This is a precious moment. It is a little parenthesis in eternity."--Paulo Coelho, The Alchemist <br>
"It changed my whole life. I realized all of the people who had conspired to get me to this place." --Pharrell Williams, musician and songwriter
